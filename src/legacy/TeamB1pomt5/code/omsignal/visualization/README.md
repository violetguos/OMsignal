# Visualization

This directory contains files for the visualization of the OMSignal data and of several steps in our analysis. 

## Data exploration

### Feature correlation

`correlation.py` is a script that produces plots about the distribution and correlation of the `PR`, `RT`, and `RR` regression targets. It takes no command line arguments, and can simply be run like this:

```
python correlation.py
```

### Dimensionality reduction

`dimensionality_reduction.py` is a script containing functions for visualization of data after applying various methods of dimensionality reduction. It can be run like this:

```
python dimensionality_reduction.py dr_method --cluster --centroid
```

where the arguments are:
* `dr_method` - the method of dimensionality reduction; can be one of `pca`, `tsne`, or `pca_tsne` (which performs t-SNE after PCA)
* `--cluster` - flag when running on the cluster
* `--centroid` - flag for a plot of the centroids of each participant's data, instead of all participants' datapoints

### Signal viewing

`display_window.py` is a script containing functions for the line-graph visualization of the raw and/or preprocessed ECG signal. It generates a plot of the ECG signal and of its FFT. It can be run like this:

```
python display_window.py nb_plots --cluster --normalize --truncate --norandom
```

where the arguments are:
* `nb_plots`- the number of ECG signals to examine and plots to generate
* `--cluster` - flag when running on the cluster
* `--normalize`- flag to normalize the ECG signals
* `--truncate` - flag to truncate the plot to a certain window; this argument must also be supplied with a beginning and ending point between 0 and 30 inclusive, e.g. `--truncate 1 2`to truncate the signal to the window between 1 and 2 seconds
* `--norandom` - flag to specify explicitly which signals to plot, overriding the default random selection; this argument must be supplied with indices, e.g. `--norandom 15 30 66`

## Network training

`learning_curves.py`is a script that generates learning curves for every log generated by a trained model that is present in the root `logs/`directory. It takes no command line arguments, and can simply be run like this:

```
python learning_curves.py
```
